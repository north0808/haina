wcecompat: Windows CE Runtime Library "compatibility" library.

LICENSE

This software is licensed under the terms and conditions in the LICENSE file.


ABOUT
-----
This software is derived from the work by Steven Reddie from Essemer Pty Ltd.
For contact information, see README_essemer.txt.
As Essemer was not continuing this project it has been forked and republished.
The new version is supposed to stay compatible with previous versions plus add
support for Windows CE 5 and later.


NOTE
----
This is work in progress and the content might change at any point in time.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
wcecompat requires the following software:
- Perl (to create the makefile configuration)
- Embedded Visual Studio 3/4 or Visual Studio 2005/following
- A Windows CE SDK


BUILDING
--------
- Ensure your environment is setup for crosscompilation for the target Windows
  CE platform. Refer to the documentation in case you are not sure how to do so.
- Depending on your version of Windows CE, you will have to set some environment
  variables. These are
   * OSVERSION: A string composed by "WCE" plus the version number ,eg. WCE500
                Note that eg. Windows Mobile 5 is based on Windows CE 5.01, so
                be sure about the proper setting. Otherwise runtime issues might
                occur.
   * TARGETCPU: The CPU architecture the SDK is designed for (eg. X86, ARMV4I,...)
   * PLATFORM : For Windows CE previous to 5.00 this might be needed, but is
                deprecated from this version on.
- Call 'perl config.pl' to create the makefile configuration for your setup. In case
  you do not have perl available, continue reading below to create your own 
  configuration without using perl.
- Call 'nmake'
- After successful compilation you will have "wcecompat.lib" and "wcecompatex.lib"
  in your lib directory. These libraries are generated statically and are supposed
  to be linked into your project.
