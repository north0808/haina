qTwitter is an application interacting with microblogging services, such as Twitter, Identi.ca and others based on StatusNet application (former laconica). It aims to be as compact as possible still providing outstanding usability. Since it's a Qt-based application with no other dependencies, it works wherever Qt does, i.e. Windows, Mac OS X and vast variety of Linuxes and Unices supporting X11 (including Nokia's Maemo platform).

Features' summary as for v0.10.0:
  - OAuth-based authentication scheme for Twitter accounts,
  - support for Twitter, Identi.ca and StatusNet for:
    * friends and mentions (@-replies) timeline,
    * posting, replying, retweeting, deleting and (dis)favoring statuses,
    * downloading, sending and deleting direct messages,
  - secure (SSL encrypted) connection to Twitter and Identi.ca,
  - support for working with multiple accounts at the same time,

HOW TO INSTALL:

You can either compile qTwitter with support for OAuth authorization you will need

To compile qTwitter you'll need Qt libraries version 4.4.3 or newer. You will need QCA and QOAuth library to enable support for OAuth authorization. From version 0.8.3 qTwitter depends on qoauth 1.0 or higher. You'll find all needed info at http://wiki.github.com/ayoy/qoauth.

Follow the steps to compile qTwitter:

1. Get the qTwitter source code from qt-apps.org or GitHub (http://github.com/ayoy/qtwitter).
2. Enter the source code main directory.
3. Type:

  # qmake
  # make (or make release, depending on your Qt configuration)

4. It's done! Open qTwitter via "qtwitter" (UNIX), "qtwitter.app" (MacOS X) or "release\qtwitter.exe" (Windows). On UNIX-like machines you can also:
  # make install
  
  to have the app added to /usr/bin. If you want to install application in other dir, use PREFIX parameter with qmake:

  # qmake PREFIX="my/preferred/dir"
  # make
  # make install

5. Have fun :-)
